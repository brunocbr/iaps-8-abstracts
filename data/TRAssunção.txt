This paper will attempt to investigate two propositions by Heraclitus of Ephesus, formulated in differentiated and autonomous maxims (*gnômai*), about death (*thánatos*): the “fragments” 21 and 27 in Hermann Diehl’s edition numbering. “Fragment” 21 – which we could literally translate like this: “Death is how much things we see while awake; and how much (we see) sleeping (is) sleep.” – seems to paradoxically define death as what we would more commonly call “awakened (perceptual) life”, as if returning to a Heraclitic model of unity (or reciprocal complementarity) between the elementary opposites which are “life” and “death”. “Fragment” 27 – whose literal translation could be something like: “Humans who die await many things they neither expect nor imagine.” –, in turn, seems to define the very phenomenon of death as an ultimate “event”, as such (supposedly) not yet experienced by any living human being, and therefore as something entirely unknown and not subject to any prior form of knowledge. The investigation will be less focused on a careful analysis of the two different contexts of the same great work (*Stromateis* III, 3, 21, 1 and IV, 22, 144, 3) by Clement of Alexandria in which the fragments are cited, than on an attempt to think about each of the two propositions in relation to other thematically connected propositions in the whole of Heraclitus’ “fragments”, and then also try to think about the possible relationships between one and the other. In addition to important specific articles such as those by Gregory Vlastos, a relatively well-known common bibliographic base will be made up of the Greek text, translations and commentaries on editions by Marcovich, Bollack and Wissmann, Kahn, and Laks and Most, as well as the books by Clémence Ramnoux (*Héraclite ou l’homme entre les choses et les mots*) and Roman Dilcher (*Studies in Heraclitus*).
