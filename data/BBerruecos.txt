The abstract discusses the insecure and problematic nature of Parmenides' Poem and the extensive amount of discussion, amendments, corrections, and conjectures that have been made on its verses. The presentation proposes to analyze seven uncertain passages in the poem (B1.13, B8.1, B8.7-B8.12, B8.36, B12.1, and B12.5) and how the metrical structure can shed light on the corruption in transmission and the suitability of different conjectures.
