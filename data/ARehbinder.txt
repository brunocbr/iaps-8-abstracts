The famous definition of *logos* as a “powerful master”, δυνάστης μέγας, in the *Encomium of Helen* (§ 8) is followed by a relative sentence, where *logos* is presented as a “body”:

> ὁς σμικροτάτῳ σώματι καὶ ἀφανεστάτῳ θειότατα ἔργα ἀποτελεῖ  
> which, by the smallest and the most invisible body realizes the most divine actions.

This description of *logos* as a body doesn’t seem to be accidental: it can be linked to two other passages of the discourse. First, it echoes the evocation of the power of Helen’s beauty, which is described too as a relation between bodies:

> ἑνὶ δὲ σώματι πολλὰ σώματα συνήγαγεν ἀνδρῶν  
> by a single body she assembled many bodies of men (§ 4)

Second, it is coherent with the comparison of the power of *logos* to the action of drugs on bodies in the § 14. The purpose of my paper will be to scrutinize the implications of this association of *logos* with a body: on the one hand, it shows the importance that Gorgias gives to the stuff of language, which becomes an independent way of persuasion. On the second hand, the sophist seems to operate a reification of *logos*, against its vision as a mere intellectual or spiritual reality. I will try to relate this vision of *logos* to Gorgias’ psychology, and in particular to the definition of δόξα and ὄψις as instances independent of ψύχη and able to influence it. Finally, I will try to show the links between Gorgias’ Encomium of Helen and Plato’s theory of the power of poetry in *Republic* II-III. The hypothesis of a relation between the two texts is proved, in my view, by lexical coincidences, and in particular the metaphor of τύπος for a text forming a soul.
