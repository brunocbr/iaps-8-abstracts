Interpreters now commonly agree that Timon of Phlius used Xenophanes as his mouthpiece for the parodies he launches against philosophers in his Silloi. But why have a mouthpiece and why Xenophanes? The standard view holds that Xenophanes may easily be seen to represent a sort of precursor of sceptic Pyrrhonism. But, I claim, this is only one part of the story. I would like to show that two other, no less important, reasons were behind this choice. First, Xenophanes was also a poet, and an especially adept, actually the creator, of philosophical satires (to the point that his iambic poems were at some point calledSilloi as well). And secondly, and more importantly, Xenophanes was the very first philosopher to criticise Homer and his conception of the gods where humour and parody are of crucial importance. And, the other way around, Timon’s main humourous device is the use of Homeric (parts of) verses in his own satirical verses. Having Xenophanes as the mouthpiece for a humorous, satirical, critique of all philosophers (including other presocratics such as Heraclitus and Parmenides) before Pyrrho must thus be seen as a sort of reenacting of that first, devastating, critique against the ‘father’ of poetry and, more generally, of the ‘knowledge’ of what the divine and virtues should amount to.
