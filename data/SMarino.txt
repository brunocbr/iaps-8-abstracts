The treatise *De genitura/De natura Pueri* is the first text to have survived in its entirety that analyzes the formation of the sperm and the development of the embryo. However, it is set into a medical-scientific context already established. As several scholars have already pointed out, Democritus seems to be the author who exerted the greatest influence on this medical treatise. In both authors there is a theory of sperm production and character inheritance. Therefore, this paper aims at finding a solution to the problem of compatibility between the humoral theory of *Genit./Nat.Puer*. and Democritus’ atomistic theory. The problem arises in understanding the mechanism that allows the phenotypic transmission of the two parents: a plausible solution, which I propose, is that, in both authors, the phenotypes are transmitted by means of the seed that comes from both parents and gives rise to the embryo, which later is structured by accretion of the various types of seed (those derived from the various parts of the body) according to the general physical principle of aggregation *per similes*.

Indeed, there are many connections between *Genit./Nat.Puer*. and Democritus, suggesting a common solution for the problem: 1) some testimonies point to a humoral theory in Democritus: DK68A153, A 154, A155, A162; 2) sperm is derived from the whole body: DK68A141, DK68B124; 3) both woman and man emit fertile sperm: DK68A142; 4) woman desires to unite sexually: DK68A142; 5) sex determination depends on sperm predominating in quantity: *Genit*.VI 1 and DK68A143; 6) in *Genit./Nat.Puer*. XVII, the experiment of the artificial 
bladder, by which the author shows that things of the same nature cluster in the same place, takes up the physical principle of DK68B164.
Given these premises, I will argue that it is possible to find compatibility between the two authors.
