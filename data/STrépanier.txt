Column IV of the Derveni papyrus is justly famous for its integration of two fragments of Heraclitus (DK B 3 + B 94) into a single new fragment on the sun and its relation to the Erinyes. After a review of the context and the preserved sections of the column, I offer three new suggestions for the text, following the editions of Betegh (2004), KTP (2006), and Piano (2016):

  
> [5] κατὰ [ταὐτ]ὰ Ἡράκλειτος μα[ρτυρόμενος] τὰ κοινὰ  
> κατ[αγρά]φει τὰ ἴδ[ι]α, ὅς περὶ κει̣[μένωι] λόγωι λέγων [ἔφη·]  
> “ἡλί[ου τὸ ἐ]μοῦ κατὰ φύσιν ἀνθρω[πηΐου] εὖρος ποδός [ἐστι,]  
> τὸ μ[έγεθο]ς οὐχ ὑπερβάλλων. εἰ γ̣ά[ρ τι οὔ]ρους ἑ[αυτοῦ]  
> [ὑπερβαλε]ῖ, Ἐρινύε[ς] νιν ἐξευρήσου[σι, Δίκης ἐπίκουροι·

In the same way Heraclitus, while testifying to matters common/open to all, enrols as his witnesses his private testimony, who, speaking on behalf of established tradition, said: ‘Of the sun, the width is of my own human foot according to nature

1) instead of Sider’s ἴκελα [τῶι ἱερο]λόγωι I propose περὶ κει̣[μένωι] λόγωι ‘on behalf of (peri + dative) the received account’. In the previous lines the author mentions κείμενα‘things received’ i.e. ‘tradition’. Heraclitus, like the author, retains tradition i.e. talks of Erinyes.
2) I propose ἡλί[ου τὸ ἐ]μοῦ In other words, Heraclitus related the width of the sun to *his own specific* foot. This is supported by the mention in l. 4 of τὰ ἴδ[ι]α things private or related to an individual. 3) we can make sense of that mention of ‘the private’by retaining the supplement μα[ρτυρόμενος] τὰ κοινὰ ‘bearing witness to what is common’ and supplying the missing verb as κατ[αγρά]φει call upon/summon (in writing) LSJ II.3. This produces a nice, deliberate ambiguity, the universal logos expressed through the logos of Heraclitus the individual.
