The work revisits Ugo Bianchi's thesis (1974) about Orphism being a religion of the book (*religion du livre*). Bianchi's thesis was important because it consolidated the idea of purification (*telete*) as a successful religious ritual due to the use of *ta Orphica* verses and essays. Exactly fifty years have passed since then, Bianchi's thesis has been received almost always positively, especially in the circle led by Bernabé and Casadesús (2008). But does it maintain its relevance in light of a new critical examination? The methodology will consist of revisiting Bianchi's text, resuming his arguments in favor of his thesis, and discussing its relevance in light of what has progressed since then. For this, some materials are analyzed, including gold plates (2004), the *Derveni Papyrus* (2016) as the main Orphic document and, also, isolated fragments of Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Parmenides, and Empedocles.
