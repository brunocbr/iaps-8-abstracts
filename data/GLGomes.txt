There are plenty of biographical reports about Democritus, but the quality of 
the material is often a little dubious. In this text, I will analyze the testimonies about a possible visit by Democritus to Athens, an issue that seems to have been the subject of some controversy in antiquity. The case is reported by Diogenes Laertius through two conflicting testimonies, coincidentally provided by two different Demetriuses: that of Magnesia, active during the 1st century BCE, and that of Phaleron, active at the turn of the 4th to the 3rd century BCE. Between the two accounts, Diogenes inserts a comment by Thrasyllus (1st century BCE) about a possible identification of Democritus with an anonymous character from a pseudo-Platonic dialog called *Rival Lovers*. Having become the great hub of Greek culture and intellectuality in the 5th century BCE, Athens was a common – and perhaps even inevitable – destination for the great thinkers of that period, many of whom were mentioned by Plato in his dialogues. It will emerge from the analysis of the Diogenian material that one of the probable reasons for the controversy – and perhaps even for the creation of a fiction involving an incognito visit by Democritus to Athens – may have been precisely to justify the fact that Plato never mentioned him in any of the authentic dialogues that remained.
