We intend to investigate, initially, a distinction established by Antiphon in his treatise *On Truth*, between two spaces that could be characterized as 'public' and 'private,' which overlap with the typical Sophistic antithesis between *nómos* and *phýsis*.

Starting from this division, we aim to shed light on the role played by vision in one of these spaces. Indeed, by highlighting a sort of microphysics of codification, Antiphon points out that the law dictates what the eyes must see, what the ears must hear, what the tongue must utter, what the feet must go after, and the objects the mind must desire. For Antiphon, engaging in public life involves conforming each part
of the body to the modes imposed by the law. However, within this list, vision assumes a central role, as our hypothesis posits, insofar as it is accompanied—in the remainder of the treatise—by a whole constellation of concepts revolving around it. We refer to the use of the verbs *oîda* and *lantháno*, the inclusion of the figure of the *márturos*, and the role of *aischúne*, as each of these elements contributes to shaping a public arena in which everyone sees everything and everyone is seen by everyone. Thus, the eyes become responsible for overseeing not only major transgressions but also the slightest violations of norms. Having outlined this panorama, finally, we will shed light on the close parallels between Antiphon's proposal and that developed by Gorgias in his *Defense of Palamedes*, where the Sophist from Leon noi also places the eye and gaze at the center of the public sphere.
