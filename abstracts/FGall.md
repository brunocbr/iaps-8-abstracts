The aim of this presentation is to raise hypotheses about why Democritus became known in antiquity as the "laughing philosopher", notably from a series of letters attributed to Hippocrates. Although his ethics seem to have focused on the notion of cheerfulness (*euthumia*), nothing in the fragments that have come down to us seems to corroborate the portrait presented by Pseudo-Hippocrates, nor do they point to a direct contrast with Heraclitus, who came to be known as the "weeping philosopher". We therefore propose to investigate the reason for this characterization.
