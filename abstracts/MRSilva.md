In modern specialized literature, Heraclitus’ *logos* is a prolific and complex topic. Many different readings and arguments have been evocated, but three main directions can be outlined: some tends to interpret it as an “intellective” notion, others prefer an “ontological” reading, and other yet a “discursive” one. In this scenario, following some points of the incisive critique provided by Gianvittorio (2010), as well as remarks already presented by various authors such as West (1971) and Robinson (2006), this paper aims to present an eminently discursive reading. However, this should not mean that Heraclitus’ lógos could be described as a "merely discursive” notion. Although the discursive meaning may be prominent and primary, others are skillfully explored by Heraclitus. By those successive semantic shifts, the notion gains complexity. In the opening lines of DK 22 B 1, for example, is already remarkable the problematization of this "discourse" as a message that may or may not be understood, as well as some metonymical suggestions. Similarly, in fragments such as DK 22 B 50, 87, and 45, as was already pointed out by Hülsz (2011), Heraclitus explores multiple meanings of *logos*, expanding its discursive meaning by placing it in the core of a reflection about reality. Highlighting such textual effects, I intend to emphasize Heraclitus' view of language as a fundamental concept for understanding the universe, precisely because it functions as a mirror of reality, without, however, juxtaposing itself with it. Therefore, despite language for Heraclitus is not the divine law that governs the universe, it remains its expression and the medium by which human beings can eventually comprehend reality.
