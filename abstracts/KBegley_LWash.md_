The main thesis of this paper is that Empedocles is a composer of rhymes—not accidental or merely ornamental ones, but rhymes serving his poetico-philosophical program. This is not so far-fetched as it may seem. The introduction of *homoioteleuton* (the use of “like endings” for neighboring cola) was attributed to Gorgias, who was reportedly Empedocles’ pupil, and Empedocles himself allegedly invented rhetoric (see Diels 1884). Nevertheless, Norden (1898) posited that there is no rhyme worth speaking of as such prior to Gorgias, while any rhyme in poetry written after him is the result of his unfortunate influence. Despite Norden, some consideration has been given of homoioteleuton in earlier poets (esp. Guggenheimer 1972), but the consideration has not been systematic, and so the argument against Norden has not gained traction. A foothold for that argument can be found in Empedocles, whose fragments contain numerous remarkable instances of homoioteleuton, as in fr. 17.34–35: ἀλλ’ αὐτ’ ἔστιν ταῦτα, δι’ ἀλλήλων δὲ θέοντα / γίγνεται ἄλλοτε ἄλλα καὶ ἠνεκὲς αἰὲν ὁμοῖα, where the rhyme reinforces the message that the elements, although becoming different, remain the same. Empedocles’ homoioteleuton is thus comparable to other Empedoclean repetition (see esp. Gheerbrant 2017), but Empedocles’ use should also be compared with that of other early Greek poets. With the goal of a systematic study of the phenomenon, we have developed a computer program that enables such comparison as well as large-scale statistical analysis. In this paper, then, we have three purposes: i) to introduce our larger project, the computer program, and some initial results bearing on the question of whether there is any significant use of homoioteleuton prior to Gorgias; ii) to situate Empedocles in particular within the scholarly debate on homoioteleuton; and iii) to offer a provisional analysis of the role of homoioteleuton in his verses.
