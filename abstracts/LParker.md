This paper considers the relationship between *phusis* and *logos* in the extant texts of Heraclitus, focusing especially on the explicit contrast between a *logos* that is 'common' (Laks-Most D2/Diels-Kranz B2) and a *phusis* that tends to conceal itself (LM D35/DK B123) even as both Heraclitus' textual exposition (D1/B1) as well as right speech and action (D114b/B112) take place 'in accordance with nature,*kata phusin*. Importantly, I think, in each case what takes place *kata phusin* is human expression and action: the 'words and works' (ἐπέων καὶ ἐργῶ)
Heraclitus claims to be setting forth in D1/B1 and the 'speaking and acting' (λέγειν καὶ ποιεῖν) of the wise and virtuous in D114b/B112. For Heraclitus, then, attention to phusis may have special relevance for the limited epistemic position of human beings.

A great deal of attention has been paid to both *logos* and *phusis* in Heraclitus' texts. So far, however, studies tend to treat each idea in isolation (e.g., Johnstone 2014 makes no mention of *phusis* and Most 2016 none of *logos*) or they ultimately conflate the two principles.(1)

I argue that *logos* expresses the totality of things in their interrelation, while *phusis*, in denoting the individual character of each thing, may "conceal itself" insofar as an entity's being is determined by the individual's ever-changing relations to others and to the unity of the world in its entirety. In this way, *logos* and *phusis* may express the dialectical relations between whole and part in a self-ordering *kosmos* that maintains its unity in a constantly shifting pattern of diversity. This interpretation lets us make sense of the conjunction of expression and action where we see *kata phusin* in Heraclitus, as well as understanding how it is that the character of *phusis* itself is, for Heraclitus, concealment.

(1) Naddaf (2005, 129-132) acknowledges the complexity of the relationship here but ultimately identifies both *logos* and *phusis* with fire as the material principle and process of the *kosmos*: "in the physical universe, *logos* manifests itself as fire 1 Heraclitus chose fire as the *phusis* as *archê*." NighAngale (2007, 189) reaches a similar conclusion: "For Heraclitus, *physis is Logos* (and vice-versa)." Tor (2018) draws on Heraclitus' *logos* and emphasis on the way in which language signifies to interpret the sense of *philei* in D35/B123 but argues that we must ultimately understand this statement and *physis* in Heraclitus more generally in terms of his theology, framing the 'inquiry into nature as an inquiry into the inclinations and will of a divine person.'
