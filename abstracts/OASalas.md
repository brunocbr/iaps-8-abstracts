In this paper I will address some instances of an issue that has received some attention in recent years, in connection with research on what counts as a real proof and on argumentative patterns employed by serious thinkers and jesting amateurs alike. I mean the early appearance of what can be termed a thought experiment, that is, a reasoning device whereby a situation is outlined which rarely (if at all) may be encountered in real life or utterly challenges common sense expectations. To this type of argumentative strategies belong such counterintuitive thinking patterns like the paradoxes and similar counterfactual conundrums that became widely diffused among 5th century intellectuals.

I will argue that this trend of thought, which may already be found in 6th century Presocratics, like Xenophanes and Parmenides, found early on its way to Sicily. There, it is conspicuously instanced in Epicharmus’ αὐξανόμενος λόγος or “growing argument” (23B2DK), which builds up on the idea of a potentially infinite series of material states and became most likely both a source and a target for some of Zeno’s extant arguments against plurality and motion. Such a pair of thought experiments is then shown to be a “chain reaction”, as the strategies employed by both thinkers —like the shocking analysis of growth and motion alike as taking place by sharply marked-off steps, i.e. as an infinite series of instantaneous transitions over what is viewed as a discontinuous stretch of track in the ‘Stadium’, and the dramatical lay- out of the paradoxical situation portrayed in the ‘Achilles’— will be shown to rely on remarkably similar mechanisms, both of them sensationally analyzing continuous processes as a ‘cinematographic’ succession of ‘frozen’ frames.

All these, in its turn, may arguably be seen as instances of counterintuitive thinking patterns that proceeded not only from philosophy to theater, but that also reached such unclassifiable thinkers like Gorgias.
