The assumption that the optimal and healthy condition of a living organism can be equated with a balanced mixture (*sym/metriê krasis*) of opposing qualities in the body is explicitly accepted in several Hippocratic texts (such as *Aer., Nat. hom., VM*, and *Vict*.), in late Plato and Aristotle. From a historical perspective, recent studies suggest two points of influence: (a) Plato and Aristotle drew inspiration from the medical tradition, and (b) the medical idea itself may have been influenced by the ideas of pre- Socratic thinkers like Parmenides, Alcmaeon, and Empedocles.

This paper aims to investigate the early history of this concept and analyze the pre-Socratic evidence within the context of medical thought. The central questions addressed are to what extent the theories of mixture proposed by the pre-Socratic philosophers influenced the ideas presented in the Hippocratic texts and what original contributions the medical tradition made to this theory, which went on to have a significant impact on both philosophical and medical thinking.

I will attempt to show that the fragments of Parmenides (B 16) and Empedocles (B 22), although attesting the key term "krasis", do not show a specific focus on themes related to health and illness, nutrition and environmental factors that are typical of medical statements, nor do they explicitly express the concept of balance. In contrast, Alkmaeon's account (B 4) is a unique precursor to the concept of balance and its important role in medicine. However, it does not express this theory using the terminology of *"krasis"* and *"sym/metriê"* (technical terms found in Hippocratic texts, Plato and Aristotle), nor does it suggest any direct relationship between the human body and factors such as food, exercise, environment and other aspects specific to medical discourse, as well as discussions of health found in the works of the most prominent philosophers.
