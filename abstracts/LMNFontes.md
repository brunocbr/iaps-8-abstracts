According to Plato, in a report that has been widely accepted, Zeno’s arguments were meant to defend Parmenides’ One from attacks by showing pluralism to be false and/or incoherent.
Although widespread, this view is not monolothic: Eudemus, for one, has challenged it. In a famous report, Eudemus claims that Zeno *attacked* Parmenides’ One, presenting as evidence what now we know as DK 29 B1-2. According to modern scholarly consensus, this text concludes that each *one* of the many things either has no parts - and, therefore, no magnitude, and no being - or it has parts - in which case its parts will either have no parts (and no magnitude and no being) or it will have parts, and on and on, which would purportedly prove that each one of the many things that are has infinite magnitude.
At least two things, however, remain puzzling on this reconstruction. First, what is the force of Zeno’s argument in its original dialectical context? That is, why would the target of Zeno’s argument accept that a partless thing is also extensionless? And why would anyone accept that a plurality of ever diminishing parts - albeit an infinite plurality - yields an infinite extension? Secondly, how come Zeno’s arguments do not harm the view he supposedly defends - namely, that the One is? For either this One will have parts or it won’t - and, in any case, it would seem to fall prey to Zeno’s arguments.
For me, the simplest explanation to these puzzles is that Eudemus was right: Zeno was indeed attacking Parmenides. In my talk, I will point to evidence that these arguments are best understood not as generic attacks against Parmenides, but rather as attacks based on a close reading of some puzzling passages of Parmenides’ poem.
