There is much discussion in the scholarship about whether Plato’s and Aristotle's presentations of Heraclitus’ thought correspond perfectly to the positions found in the Ephesian’s work, or whether they correspond rather to a caricatured vision that serves the objectives of the works in which he is referred to (e.g. *Cratylus*, *Theaetetus*, *Metaphysics*): see *inter alia* Mondolfo 1953, Vlastos 1955, Ramnoux 1968, Kahn 1979, Conche 1991, Colli 1993, Tarán 1999, Fronterotta 2015. Platonic and Aristotelian doxography attributed to Heraclitus his most famous position, the “universal flux” or “everything flows” (*pánta rhei*), which seems to be attested by three fragments, the well-known “river” fragments (DK 22 B12, B49a, and B91). Nonetheless, the recognition that the image of the “river” and its fragments are authentically Heraclitean has been contested by several scholars, on the basis of the conception of the so-called “union of opposites”, attested by more than 20 fragments of the philosopher (B8, B23, B48, B50, B51, B53, B54, B59, B60, B61, B62, B65, B67, B76, B80, B82, B83, B84a, B88, B103, B111, and B126). For some (Reinhardt 1916, Kirk 1978, Marcovich 1967), the “river” analogy as representing the whole reality is a Platonic creation. These scholars point to the fact that only one of the three “river” fragments, namely B91, affirms the thesis of “universal flux”, being Plato its first doxographic source. Concerning the other two fragments, the quotation context of B12 in Eusebius’ text makes it clear that Heraclitus made not a *“potamoí-ónta”* but rather a *“potamoí-psychaí”* analogy. And in B49a, apparently Heraclitus, instead of affirming the “universal flux”, affirms the “union of opposites” (Marcovich 1967, O’Brien, 1990). On the basis of the analysis of the scholars' arguments, this paper will assess whether the famous “river” image is a creation of Heraclitus or Plato.
