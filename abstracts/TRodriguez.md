Steiris (2019) states that “Fifteenth century humanists, notably Marsilio Ficino (1433– 1499) and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494), reappraised the importance of 
Presocratic philosophy and acknowledged its influence on ancient Greek philosophy.” 
Given Ficino’s and Pico’s interest in expanding the prevailing philosophical canon and in reevaluating the positions of presocratic philosophers, this paper aims to show such a reevaluation specifically in Pico's thought.
Pico’s enterprise of recovery of all knowledge available in his time is well known. In this sense, the year 1486 is of special importance since it constitutes the period during which he assembled his *900 theses* and wrote the famous *Oratio* later called 'On the Dignity of Man'. Additionally, he wrote his *Commento sopra una canzone d’amore*. The presocratics and especially Empedocles play a prominent role in these works, not only as pre-platonic sages but also as important influences in the structure of his own philosophical proposal. Empedocles' name appears three times in the *900 theses*, three in the *Oratio*, and once in the *Commento*. By analyzing these passages, I intend to show that Pico's reading is close to a Neoplatonic interpretation of Empedocles (characterized by Dillon in 2005 as a non literal reading), especially in his thesis II.5.5. In addition, I intend to show that his interpretation of Empedocles’ Love and Strife is important to support his project of constituting a *pax philosophica* as he assesses the position of Empedocles as superior to that of Heraclitus (in *Commento*, II. 8). Finally, in the *Oratio*, he presents Empedocles as a forerunner of his positions on the human soul.
