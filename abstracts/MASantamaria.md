We have evidence that the first figure to apply the allegoresis to the Homeric poems was Theagenes of Rhegium (late sixth century BC), who offered an original interpretation of some passages of the *Iliad* as if they were concealing a hidden message (1). Theagenes (sch. B *Il*. 20.67) inaugurated the two kinds of allegoresis that became customary some centuries later: the physical and the less prominent psychological or moral approach. In his view, for example, Hephaestus is fire and Poseidon water, and Athena is intelligence and Ares foolishness. The next figure in the history of allegoresis was Metrodorus of Lampsacus, in the late fifth century BC. For Metrodorus (Tatian. *Orat*. 21) (2), the *Iliad*’s heroes stand for the parts of the cosmos (Achilles is the sun and Hector the moon), and the gods, most strangely, for bodily organs (Demeter is the liver and Dionysus the spleen). This puzzling approach probably involves a scientific interpretation, since in medical texts organs were related with states of humor and types of characters.
It is remarkable that in the same time in which Metrodorus wrote (or taught) his theories, the anonymous author of the Derveni Papyrus was also conceiving his physical allegoresis of an Orphic poem. According to him, the name ‘Zeus’ really refers to air, ‘Demeter’ to earth and ‘Olympus’ to time (3).
This paper will try to explain which is the rationale behind Metrodorus’ interpretation of ‘Dionysus’ and ‘Demeter’ as referring to human organs and of the Homeric heroes to parts of the universe, comparing it with the previous allegoresis of Theagenes and the contemporary activity of the Derveni author.
