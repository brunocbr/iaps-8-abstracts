Our study traces some possibilities of thinking about the reception of Democritus of Abdera's notion of array (*táxis*), especially in rhetorical parameters of Cicero and Thomas Hobbes, i.e., *táxis* as *dispositio* from rhetoric. To support our hypothesis, we will analyze from this point of view Aristotle (*Metaph*.I.4.985b 5–21) and Diodorus Siculus (Hist. 1.8.1-9) doxographies about atomist philosophy. These passages point to ideas that were incorporated into both the *dispositio* and concepts of the arts of eloquence, especially in the birth of cities, political life, and the art of rhetoric itself. There are many fields of knowledge (ethics, metaphysics, politics, physics, etc.) to systematize the work of Democritus Abdera and we suspect that rhetoric or some art of good speaking can also compose this framework.
