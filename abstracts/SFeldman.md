title: "Heraclitus' [Anti]logos and the Limits of Human Speech"
---
This paper offers a new angle on the debate between “deflationist” vs. “ontological” translations of Heraclitus’ *logos*, especially as the term appears in the programmatic fragments B1 and B50. “Deflationist” interpreters such as West or Sedley hold that *logos* in these fragments simply refers to Heraclitus’ own speech or discourse; they claim that the “ontological” interpretations of *logos* (e.g., the Stoic “cosmos” , Kirk’s “measure-formula”) are anachronistic. The deflationary interpretation, however, can only be maintained by glossing over the paradoxicality that results from a literal, speech-oriented translation.

I take as my starting-point the middle way popularized by Kahn 1979: *logos* is both Heraclitus’ account and the cosmic structure that his account “intends or points at”. My interpretation differs from that of other “moderates”, however, in that I do not posit a dual translation for *logos* (speech-based vs. ontological). On my reading, the doubleness of “*logos*” arises from the gap between what the term *means* and what it *demonstrates*. The emphatic ambiguities and paradoxicality that mark Heraclitus’ use of this term do not generate a symbolic meaning above and beyond existing, speech-oriented ones. Their significance lies in transforming a term that is, by its very definition, meaningful, into one that ultimately resists and undermines meaning. On the one hand, Heraclitus’ *logos* draws out the scope and interrelation of the term’s ordinary usages, highlighting basic structures in human speech and thought. On the other hand, his *logos* puts pressure on those usages without offering any stable alternative. His paradoxical use of the term *logos* calls his audience’s attention to his discourse – and to discourse in general – even while pointing away from it. The cumulative effect is to challenge the sufficiency of human speech for communicating, and human thought for comprehending, the oneness of all things (B50) and the nature of each (B1
