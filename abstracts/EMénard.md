Several pre-Platonic cosmogonies involve a vortex that separates and distributes matter in the cosmos according to its density. We’d like to examine a few key moments in the history of this idea, based on three very different conceptions. We’ll be looking at the mechanical functioning of vortices, and more generally of circular motions, within these conceptions, defining them by some of their basic features (the origin of this motion, the forms it takes over time, its link to the separation of elements, the empirical models on which it is based, its location and the types of matter it acts upon, and the physical criteria explaining the different reactions of matter to it).

Anaximenes’ cosmogony likely involves, at the moment of star formation, the *periphorá* of the sky: however, this plays no separating role but instead allows celestial fire and earthy particles carried by exhalations to mingle, thus it is not a vortex. We suggest that it is the upward motion of the exhalations separating from the Earth that, encountering the extreme limit of the sky, is transformed into rotational motion.

In Anaxagoras, the *perikhôresis* initiated by the intellect is explicitly assigned a separating role and is extended to the whole cosmos. However, his cosmology reveals certain anomalies in the distribution of matter, the main one being the presence of dense stars at the periphery of the cosmos, a situation we shall seek to account for.

The atomistic cosmogony of Democritus, for its part, attributes a mechanical cause to the *dînos*, prompting us to describe the latter as an eddy (i.e. a turbulence-caused swirl). It also proposes a more detailed conception of its action (based on the notions of *antéreisis*, and *ekthlipsis*), that definitively avoids the difficulties encountered in Anaxagoras.
