This paper examines Empedocles' use of the adverb  (underneath) in Fragment B26, Line 7 in comparison with eleven instances of the term in Homer (eight in the *Iliad* and three in the *Odyssey*). As translated by Graham, B26.7 reads, “Until growing to be one they are completely subjected (εἰσόκεν ἓν συμφύντα τὸ πᾶν ὑπένερθε γένηται),” which I alternatively translate as, “Until growing into one the whole comes to be underneath (ὑπένερθε).” Empedocels’ use of ὑπένερθε is both obscure and crucial, as it seems to describe the Sphairos: the singular moment of absolute unity in Empedocles’ cosmic cycle. However, in Homer the term finds a clear and consistent meaning in which (1) ὑπένερθε never involves a blending, but instead a structured layering; (2) ὑπένερθε means underneath, but in a way that what is underneath keeps its integrity and distinction from what it is underneath; and (3) ὑπένερθε can mean in the underworld, with Hades thus distinguished from earth, sea, and sky (*Iliad* III.278). By considering this conception of ὑπένερθε in the context of Empedocles B26, this paper develops the foundation for an interpretation of a layered *Sphairos* where the roots exist underneath the circumference of the sphere, but in the Homeric sense of a structured layering of distinct components. At Iliad IV.146-147, Menelaus’ ankles, knees, and thighs are all ὑπένερθε (underneath)” the blood flowing from his wound, and at *Iliad* IV.184-187, the belt and apron of Menelaus’ armor are ὑπένερθε (underneath) the kilt. Likewise, when Empedocles’ four roots are ὑπένερθε to the whole (τὸ πᾶν), this describes a similarly layered structuring of the roots in which they maintain their distinct identity within the Sphairos, contradicting Aristotle’s interpretation of the Sphairos as a homogeneous unity at *GC* I.1, 315a17-18.
