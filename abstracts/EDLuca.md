The research verified two different declarations in Diogenes Laertius’ book. The first one is from Satyrus, in D.L, 3.9, that asserts that Plato wrote a letter to Dion requesting him to buy the three books of the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus of Croton. In D.L, 8.85, it is affirmed that Plato, in one of his trips to Sicily, bought from Philolaus’ parents the book of such Pythagorean and based on this work Plato would have written the *Timaeus*. Then, in that conception, Plato would be a plagiarist of the Pythagorean philosophy. The research aims to verify if Plato could be considered as a plagiarist of the Pythagorean school, specifically, Philolaus of Croton. In total, seven vestiges were found in Plato’s *Timaeus* that contain a Pythagorean theme, and a good number of them have references to Philolaus’ philosophy. Nonetheless, the conclusion of the research is that *Timaeus* is authentically platonic because several typically platonic themes are presented, such as the theory of forms, demiurgical *poiesis*, the distinction between Intellect and Necessity, etc. Therefore, the fact that the platonic work refers to a few themes of the Pythagorean philosophy does not make the *Timaeus* a copy of Philolaus’ *Pery Physeos*, but rather that Plato is in contact with the Greek tradition that precedes him, such as the poetry, Orphics mysteries, other philosophers, and philosophies.
