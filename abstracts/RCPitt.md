The work revisits Ugo Bianchi's thesis (1974) about Orphism being a religion of the book (*religion du livre*). Bianchi's thesis joins the chorus of researchers who have found in the verses of *ta Orphica* a religious expression, alongside other Greek mysteries, with their own religious and philosophical characteristics. Exactly fifty years on, the "religion of the book" thesis is being received positively, especially in the circle led by Bernabé and Casadesús (2008), who present solid arguments in favor of it. However, skeptical criticism of this thesis remains vigorous, for example in the work of Edmonds III (2013). The methodology will consist of revisiting Bianchi's text and contrasting the positions of Edmonds III and Bernabé with regard to some sources on Orphism. To this end, some Orphic fragments will be analyzed, as well as a passage from Plato's *Cratylus* (400b).
