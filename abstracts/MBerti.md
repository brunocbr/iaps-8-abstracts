Scholars believe that *all* the Presocratics work with the *same* understanding of the ‘positive’ and the ‘negative’ element in their binary oppositions between principles (Lloyd 1964, KRS 1983, McKirahan 2010, Wright 2008). I show that this is an oversimplification, using Parmenides as case study.
Binary oppositions are omnipresent in Ancient Greek cosmology and embryology (Baldry 1932). They serve the purpose of explaining the universe and its phenomena (Lloyd 1962) and can have many forms. One principle is ‘positive’ and ‘active’ (e.g., Male, Hot) because it starts change, while the other ‘negative’ and ‘passive’ (e.g., Female, Cold) because it is *affected* by the other principle (Betegh 2021). However, although scholars tried to maintain the standard view for Parmenides (Thanassas 2011), textual evidence calls into question this conclusion (Mourelatos 2008, Songe-Möller 2002, Jurnée 2012). In the *Doxa*, while Light figures as a positive element together with e.g., Fire, and Hot, Dark is the negative one together with e.g., Earth, and even Death (DK 28 46A). Nonetheless, Parmenides associated the Hot with the Female in his embryology, too (DK 52A, 53A), challenging the standard view of binary oppositions.
I show that Parmenides does not fit into the typical opposition where the Female as inferior (i.e., negative) to Men (i.e., positive) (Lloyd 1964). I start by assessing accounts on embryology (DK 13A, 51A) against the Aristotelian and Hippocratic doctrines. I argue that Aristotle’s theory, where women are ‘passive’, is the *not* the norm. Next, I show that a ‘positive’ view of the Female is consistent with the role the Goddess has in the *Aletheia* part, by comparing Hesiod’s and Homer’s use of the Female (Bergren 1983) with Parmenides. I conclude that the Female in Parmenides does not fit in a binary opposition with Male, but has a complex relation with it.
