title: How politically engaged were the pre-Socratic philosophers? The cases of Pythagoras, Parmenides, and Zeno

I argue that a prevalent trait among some pre-Socratic philosophers was their active participation in the political affairs of their *poleis*. Like many of their fellow citizens, some philosophers were accustomed to discharging civic (legislation, governance, diplomacy) and religious (priesthood, financing and organizing festivals) duties, both within their cities and (as diplomats) beyond their boundaries.

To illustrate this, I will examine the cases of Pythagoras of Samos, Parmenides of Elea, and Zeno of Elea. In the case of Pythagoras, it will be discussed his departure from Samos and his involvement in the governance of Crotona. The evidence for Parmenides and Zeno speaks for their roles as legislator (Parmenides) and political revolutionary against tyranny (Zeno). Though the evidence in these three instances may not provide conclusive support for the thesis I am advocating for, I believe that some of it can be aligned with the evidence of a range of intellectuals who perform both civic and religious duties throughout Hellas. Presocratic philosophers, with notorious exceptions like Heraclitus, were no exception to the discharge of this or other types of duties.

Thus, the notion that philosophers spurned political life due to their dedication to philosophical studies appears more like a biased assumption, reinforced by tales like that of Thales tumbling into a well, rather than a proper evaluation of the part philosophers performed as citizens in their hometowns' political scene.
