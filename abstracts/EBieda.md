In the fragments of Heraclitus of Ephesus that have come down to us, there are many references to different human capacities linked to knowledge or, in general, to the various ways in which human beings turn towards the surrounding world. We find, first, aptitudes classically close to the 'higher' intellectual faculties (cf. v.g. B 17: *manthánein*, *gignóskein*, *phroneîn*; B2: *phrónesis*; B40: *nóos*; B41: *gnómê*); on the other hand, others, also intellectual, but 'inferior' (cf. v.g. B17: *dokeîn*; B102 *hypolambánein*; B40: *polumathíê*; B46: *oíêsis*; B14: *nomízein*). Thirdly, we find faculties linked to the sensitive and the senses (cf. v.g. B1:*akoúein*; B46: *hórasis*; B107: *ophthalmós, oûs*). Likewise, along with these three types of knowledge, the fragments of Ephesus provide, fourthly, something characteristic: it is also through the senses, but through a specific use of them not equivalent to the usual one, that it is possible to capture or know the true structure of the world, its deep meaning and reason.
In the present communication I propose to analize briefly these different epistemological types with the intention of finding, if there are any, the criteria on which the Heraclitean principles of knowing rest. I do not intend, of course, to address the thought of Heraclitus in its entirety or exhaust the various problems that the topic of study entails. My objective is, if you will, more modest: to try an approach to what may have been his epistemological proposal regarding the different modes of access to the *lógos*.
