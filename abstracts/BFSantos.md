Since the publication of Kurfess (2012) work about Parmenides, it has become a tendancy between specialists, to enquire if the standart edition of his poetry, made by Diels-Kranz in the middle of 20th century, that put the *alétheia* separated from *dóxai* and cosmology, creating a tripartite division of the Poem, is correct. From 2012 to the present day, others interpreters, as Conte (2016) and Cordero (2020), has tried to reorganize the fragments, giving another order for the Poem. Cordero, for example, believes that the *dóxai* does not belongs to the cosmology, because in cosmology we find some truthful fragments that cannot be considerated as part of the erroneous discourse of mortals. The problem of this approach, as we will see and discuss in this presentation, is that it appears to disrepect the autority of the Goddess that teachs everthing to her disciple: she says, on the proem’s last verses, that he has to learn everthing, both the *alétheia*, and also the opinions of mortals. Therefore, this assumption, if we reads it carefully, makes us to questioning if it is right to reorgize the Poem, as the own Goddess seems to establish a clear division between the contents, associating cosmology with opinions, and *alétheia* with the being. In the light of this, maybe it would be more appropriate to preserve the canonical edition of Diels-Kranz, that divides the contents of the Poem and does not separate the opinions of mortals from the world (*kósmos*) named by their discourse.
