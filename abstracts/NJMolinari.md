This talk presents the most essential archaeological and literary evidence for connecting the cult of Acheloios to Thales’ philosophy, provides the basic philosophical rationale for positing influence, and explains why this new view of Thales and the origin of philosophy proper is important for the discipline as a whole. The evidence reviewed will consist of several 7th to 6th century archaic artifacts from Miletos, the Milesian colonies, and Milesian trade partners, and also various ancient accounts concerning Acheloios, especially his identification with water, his position as source of the sea (contra Okeanos), and his One-Many juxtaposition with rivers, in which the rivers of the world were seen as the ‘sinews of Acheloios.’ The philosophical rationale will consist of two components: First, I will present a modified interpretation of Aristotle’s three-fold *archai*, and demonstrate that the cult of 
Acheloios tacitly expressed each of these characteristics in a variety of compelling ways. 
Second, I will further elaborate on the One-Many dynamic inherent in Acheloian cultic 
belief, and explain how this dynamic is conducive to articulating a single ultimate principle of nature. Based on this assessment, I will insist that Thales must have developed his philosophical cosmology analogously from the Acheloian cultic context, and in sacrificing Acheloios (a central component to his *mythos*), Thales was able to articulate the demythologized” position that (divine) water was the ultimate principle. Finally, the talk will end with a consideration of the notion of philosophy itself, and maintain that by adopting Thales’ philosophical hermeneutic, which involves a beholding of a multiplicity of hermeneutical frameworks prompted by beatific vision, we can reorient ourselves toward the true *archai*.
