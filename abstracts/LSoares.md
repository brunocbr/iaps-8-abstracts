Among all the philosophies to which the writer Jorge Luis Borges refers in his work, that of the pre-Socratics occupies a central place. There are numerous references to these thinkers in his poems, stories, and essays. Among these thinkers, Heraclitus (and, to a lesser extent, Thales, Pythagoras, Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno, Empedocles, and Democritus) occupies a prominent place, from his first to his last writings. Borges admits on several occasions that Heraclitus' image of the changing river ("no one goes down twice into the waters of the same river", in Borges' version based on 22 B 12; B 49a; A 6) is his "favorite quotation". Borges' references to the Heraclitean image of the river can be schematically linked to the following interrelated topics: i) time, which for Borges is the most important of all metaphysical questions, as the problem of that which flows incessantly; ii) the transitory and fluctuating character of the human being as "other" and "same"; iii) the book and, more precisely, the reader's changing and renewed experience of reading it. From an examination of the above topics, I propose in this paper to determine the role that the figure of Heraclitus plays in Borges' corpus. I suggest that Borges appeals to the thought of Heraclitus not only to explore philosophical themes such as time, change, and permanence but above all to philosophically inquire into the nature of fiction as an artifice that allows us to find a kind of permanence in the transitory.
