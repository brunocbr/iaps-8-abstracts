Several Italian scholars have been interested in Pythagoreanism and, in particular, in its political dimension: without going to the chauvinist extremes of Capparelli (1941), various authors, starting with Rostagni (1922) and Mondolfo's revision of Zeller's work (1938), have attempted to articulate the mystical and philosophical dimensions in a 
complex historiographical whole in which the political dimension occupies a central role. 
The Italian appropriation of Pythagoreanism has its origins in Roman times and reveals 
the depth of Pythagoreanism's ethnic and political identification with Italic culture. Based on the ambiguity inherent in the term 'Italic philosophy', and making use of a variant of the legend about Pythagoras according to which he was the son of a Tyrrhenian, i.e. an Etruscan, Pythagoras is regarded as one of the ancestors of the political, philosophical and religious culture of Rome. In several Ciceronian passages, the Pythagoreans, defined as "almost our fellow-citizens, they who were then called Italic philosophers" (Cato Maior XXI: 78), become a central chapter in glorious Roman history (Tusc. Disput. IV). 
The 15th century in Italy marks a revival of the Italic tradition of Pythagoras, in the wake of the recovery of Platonism. Two leading Italian intellectual figures of this period devoted themselves to Pythagoreanism: Marcilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. The former with his project of translating the Platonic corpus strongly influenced by neo-Pythagorean exegesis, the latter with the one of articulating Pythagorean philosophy with the Kabbalah, the Chaldean Oracles and Arabic wisdom. This paper is intended to be a brief review of the ancient, medieval and Renaissance tradition on Pythagoras being italic, interpreted as a paradigmatic example of the ways in which ancient Greek philosophy was appropriated to justify a desired ethnic and cultural superiority.
