Diogenes of Apollonia (*c. fl.* 431/423 , a. C.) is a «pre-Socratic» that, even if he explained the human physio-cognitive faculties (Thphr. *Sens*., 39-48) in virtue of animal physio-anatomical differentiations (DK 64 B6 = [LM D27]), and even if he made use of a stylishly-careful straightforward way to advocating for material monism (DK 64 B5 = [LM D10]) in opposition to the pluralist thinkers — highly likely against Empedocles or Anaxagoras — , nowadays is still awaiting for being fully recognized. Neither was he a second rate Ionian philosopher, lacking any genuine originality, nor, as a whole bunch of scholars (Rudberg, Jaeger, Zafiropoulo, Cappelletti, Barnes, Dondoni, Lask-Most), through following the narrowly-schematic, if undoubtedly highly relevant, Peripatetic doxography (DK 13 A4 [=LM D7]; Thphr. *Φυσικῶν Δόξων*, Fr.2, *apud Dox. Gr.*, p. 477; DK 64 A8 [=Laks, T.7c]), are inclined to be agreed upon, an eclectic thinker, about whom one might expect to be spoken only as a kind of unreflective and out of date synthesis of what put forward Anaximenes (air as material element/principle), Leucippus (the possibility of other worlds existence) and Anaxagoras (the doctrine of *nous*). In light of the *ipsissima verba* the sources have handed down (Diogenes Laertius, Simplicius), Diogenes is not but a man of physics of great reputation; his intellectual commitment is giving a non-theological account of the *eutaxia* the Cosmos exhibits (Diller, Laks, Graham, Dreßler). My communication is an interpretative attempt to shed new light upon Diogenes of Apollonia’s philosophical standpoint, by sorting out the extent to which the material and physio-cognitive monism he advocated for has been misconstrued due to the following: (i) the intellectualist rendition πολλὰ εἰδός — from Schleiermacher and Panzerbieter onwards— has received and, likely following Theophrastus’ report (DK 64 A19 [=LM D13 {=Laks, T.8}]), (ii) Herman Unsener’s emendation (DK 64 B5 [=LM D10]), which, if seemingly soundly adequate, is yet
problematic and questionable.
