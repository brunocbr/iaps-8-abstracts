Recent research has shown that ethics was already a relevant topic of study for a considerable number of pre-Socratic philosophers (Laks, 2017). Parmenides' poem has abundant excerpts that relate to the approach to ethical issues, as ancient testimonies such as that of Aristophanes corroborate (Irribaren, 2013). It is possible to identify at least four connotative ethical aspects in Parmenides' poem. The first is the theological-cosmogonic one (DK 28 B1; B9-B19): Parmenides engages in presenting the cosmic order as previously established by divine entities, exploring additionally the need for the mortal to know such an order to better reflect on the conformity of his actions with the cosmic reality.
The second ethical aspect is deliberative; in B2 and B8, 14-16, the goddess explains that the mortal must deliberate between two paths. Therefore, he must make a choice based on rational discernment (B7, 3-5) to which each sensorial data accessed must be subjected. This proceeding distinguishes him from the uncritical crowd that carelessly welcomes any impression derived from the experience (B6, 4-9).
The third connotative ethical aspect of the poem deals with the political effects of *brotôn dóxas*: the mistakes of crowds make them manipulable through language, hence deriving the importance of pondering public speeches and the human capacity to name beings (B8, 53-55; B8, 61).
The fourth connotative ethical aspect is the pedagogical one (B1, 28-32; B8, 49-51): the goddess, whose authority is not exempt from the mortal's detailed analysis, instructs the latter in a careful and enigmatic way, inciting the young initiate to follow his path with autonomy and support.
Although Parmenides' investigation in the field of ethics constitutes an embryonic inquiry, it is plausible to maintain that his reflections contributed to the development of ethical thought, with direct consequences in his ontological and epistemological theses.
