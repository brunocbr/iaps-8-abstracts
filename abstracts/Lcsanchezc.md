In the *De Anima* Anaxagoras has an important role. Although the discussion of the predecessors is concentrated in Book I, Anaxagoras re-appears when Aristotle develops his theory of the intellect. One of Aristotle's problems is how to integrate an account of the intellective faculty into his hylomorphic model. The case of intellect is decisive in determining whether or not the soul has parts, and whether it can exist without the body.

The closest antecedent seems to be in Anaxagoras’ theory. If we restrict to the DA, Anaxagoras thought that sense-perception and thought had the same principle, or that their principles can be treated as identical (*DeAn*.404b1). However, Anaxagoras also maintained that the intellect is simple, unmixed, and pure (*DeAn*.429b24), and therefore separate. Aristotle notices that this characterization provides elements that need to be rescued by the aid of a hermeneutical device, which is the task of Book I. Aristotle mentions there Anaxagoras three times; in each case, accompanied by complaints about his lack of clarity. Still, Anaxagoras is going to come to the fore in Book III,4 twice, where Aristotle offers his analysis of the intellect and its activity (*DeAn*.429a10-ss). Remarkably, there is not a single word about any lack of clarity. On the contrary, Aristotle seems to be employing Anaxagoras' theory in a positive way, almost agreeing with it.

From this sketch something is missing, though: we don’t find any indication as to how an obscure theory turned into a profitable one. So the hermeneutical device is in the dark. My aim here is to explain this device: by making explicit those tools Aristotle is employing to read his predecessor, we can formulate a hypothesis that may explain where is Aristotle's bias introduced in his reading and whether, and if so how we can clear Aristotle's testimony of his interventions.
