Philolaus of Croton, a Presocratic philosopher glorified by ancient philosophers as well as by later scientists such as Copernicus, presents an original philosophy of nature. In the recent scholarship which was stimulated by W. Burkert (1962) he is appreciated not only as a Pythagorean but as an independent philosopher in his own right. Philolaus' theory is diverse. It relates to cosmology, astronomy, ontology and epistemology. Scholars such as J. Barnes (1982), M. Schofield (1983), C. Huffman (1993) and D. W. Graham (2014) have concentrated on his principles of world-order: the unlimiteds (*apeira*), the limiters (*perainonta*) and the harmony (*harmonia*) which unites both. However, Philolaus' theory is based on a developed concept of substance (*estô*) as well.

Philolaus uses the substance concept as "the substance of the things" (*ha estô tôn pragmatôn*). His concept has both the epistemological role of enabling knowledge and the ontological role of enabling existence (Philolaus DK B6). In Aristotle's theory of substance (*ousia*), we find similar characteristics. Aristotle used Philolaus' book, the first book to be written by a Pythagorean, as the primary source for his account of Pythagoreanism. Aristotle makes use of "substance of each thing" (*ousia hekastou*) (Met., Z, 3, 1028b35; 8, 8) and "substance of the things" (*ousia tôn pragmatôn*) (Z, 16, 1040b18-19). He regards the essence as substance (Z, 7, 1032b1-2) and gives it an epistemological role (Z, 6, 1031b20-21). His substance theory implies an ontological substantiality as well (Cat., 5, 2b3-5).

Following the similar characteristics and Aristotle's use of Philolaus' book, I argue that Philolaus' substance concept significantly contributed to Aristotle's theory of substance. In my paper I seek to analyze Philolaus' concept of substance and to explain how it contributed to Aristotle's theory of substance.
