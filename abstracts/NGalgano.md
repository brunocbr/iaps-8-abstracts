Of the three theses from the treatise “On Non-Being or Nature” the second one, “If it is, it is unknowable,” has received less attention from scholars. I believe that the main reason for this is due to their intense dedication to the first thesis, linked to Parmenides' notion of being, and the their thesis, related to communication issues of great importance to ancient rhetoric and sophistry.
However, in my opinion, there is another important reason. In the second thesis, questions of thought and cognition seem to emerge without clear connections to the two reference thinkers of this treatise, unanimously recognized as Parmenides and Melissus. In Parmenides, the issue of knowing and thinking, in critical literature, is reduced to two main approaches: one related to the philology of '*noein*' and its cognates, without studies outlining Parmenidean thinking about thought; the other, related to Parmenides' doctrine of being, where knowing and thinking are subordinate to the overall framework of Eleatic ontology.

However, recent studies show that Parmenides presents a complex and articulated analysis of human thinking and its consequences on cognition, both in its basic psychological mechanisms (such as persuasion) and in its more complex function (the human forma mentis that the researcher must maintain on the investigative path (frs. 2, 6, and 7).

Another obstacle is represented by the apparent absence of the theme of knowing and thinking in Melissus. However, it is possible to show that, although without explicit linguistic formulation, the theme is clearly present when analyzing the text with appropriate hermeneutic tools.
This work aims to present these connections between Gorgias's second thesis and the notions of knowing and thinking in Parmenides and Melissus. Based on the doctrines of knowing and thinking in Parmenides and Melissus, the study intends to demonstrate that such connections are much stronger and closer than previously assumed.The second thesis of Gorgia’s treatise “On what is not or on nature” and its relation with Eleaticism..
