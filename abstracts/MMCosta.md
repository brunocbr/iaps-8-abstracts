Written around 400 BC, partially destroyed in a funeral pyre between 340-320 BC, and discovered in 1962, the Derveni Papyrus (PD) is the oldest readable European book that we have. After intense work by archaeologists, papyrologists, philologists, and scholars of ancient philosophy, religion, and poetry, the editio princeps (KPT 2006) was published in 2006. In this edition, scholars T. Kouremenos, G. M Parássoglou, and K. Tsantsanoglou contextualize, reconstruct, translate, and comment on the text contained in the papyrus. The result is 26 incomplete columns of an anonymous text, among which the first ones (I-VI and XX) describe and discuss aspects of an initiation rite. Column VII presents some considerations about poetry and its use by Orpheus, transitioning to the following columns (VIII to XXVI) where verses of a theogony attributed to Orpheus are quoted and commented upon. According to the Author of Derveni (AD), "poetry is something strange and enigmatic to human beings, and if Orpheus himself did not want to utter eristic riddles, then \[he wanted\] in enigmas \[to teach\] great things" (column VII, 4-7). Therefore, he considers Orpheus's discourse sacred and enigmatic, approaching it with conceptual elements present in some philosophers of the nature of the 6th and 5th centuries. Thus, the AD seeks to explain and position elements of the religious text in a new context, physical/philosophical, redefining them. Following the steps of the exegesis developed by the AD throughout columns VIII to XXVI of the PD, we will seek to answer the following questions: a) which philosophers is the AD engaging with?; b) what are the "great things" (*tà megála*) to which, according to the AD, Orpheus refers?; and c) Why does Orpheus express himself "in enigmas" about them?
