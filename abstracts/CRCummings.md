While epistemic contextualism was popularized in the latter half of the 20th century, there are precursors of this view to be found in Gorgias’s *Encomium of Helen*, an epideictic speech where he defends Helen of Troy by arguing that, if she left on account of the gods, love, or the power of *logos* (speech), then she is innocent. Gorgias certainly cares most about his distinct style of speech, but that does not entail that he is intentionally misleading the audience. We should see Gorgias through the lens of epistemic contextualism because he wants to comment on the nature of *logos*.
In section 1, I will briefly outline Plato’s unflattering depiction of Gorgias in the dialogue bearing his name. In section 2, I will discuss the secondary literature on Gorgias. Remembered by Philostratus, Pausanias, Cicero, and Diodorus Siculus for innovation, not an indifference towards truth, the fragments about him paint him in a much different light than Plato did. In section 3, I will discuss epistemic contextualism, especially DeRose’s version that allows for the truth conditions of a knowledge ascription to change based on the utterer’s context. In section 4, I will outline one of Gorgias’s main arguments in *Encomium of Helen*: the power of *logos*. Gorgias cheekily warns us that speech can act on the soul as drugs do on the body during his speech (DK B11.14=LM 32 D24.14). Moreover, the audience would, like Helen, not be to blame. Instead, Gorgias himself would be, as he is the persuader (DK B11.11=LM 32 D24.11). This meta-commentary on the power of speech is directly concerned with the nature of truth. Therefore, we should see Gorgias as a precursor to epistemic contextualism rather than someone unconcerned with truth.
