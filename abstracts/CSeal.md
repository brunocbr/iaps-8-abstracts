Anaxagoras is generally viewed as having little interest in ethics. Indeed, he is the only major early Greek thinker not allotted a chapter in a recent massive multi-authored history of early Greek ethics (Wolfsdorf 2020). This view is rooted both in the paucity of Anaxagoras’ surviving remarks on ethics and in an ancient biographical tradition that emphasizes his abstention from the ordinary activities of social life. Nevertheless, André Laks has given Anaxagoras a key place in his tripartite taxonomy of Presocratic ethics, in which he distinguishes philosophers who elaborate an ethical theory continuous with their cosmological views (e.g. Parmenides) from those who pursue only one of the two lines of inquiry (e.g. Anaxagoras) and from those who appear to discern some sort of tension between the conclusions reached by inquiry into nature and the principles that should govern human life (e.g. Empedocles). Laks writes that the two chief members of his second category, Anaxagoras and Protagoras,

This paper aims to extend and qualify Laks’ analysis through an examination of the ethical doctrines attributed to Anaxagoras. I argue that while the mere existence of these remarks might seem to blur the picture of Anaxagoras’ separation of ethics from physics, their content bears out the claim that he separates the two lines of inquiry. This very separation, though, allows for physical study to emerge as a distinct focal point around which a life can be oriented. With special attention to Anaxagoras’ contention that observation of the cosmos is what makes human life choiceworthy (DK A30) and to the remarks in Plato’s *Phaedrus* (269e-270a) about the utility of Anaxagoras’ teaching for Pericles’ political career, I aim to show how Anaxagoras’ detachment of physics from ethics issues in a distinctive and fertile ethical perspective.
