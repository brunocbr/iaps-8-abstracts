In this presentation, I will examine the issue of compatibility between Gorgias’ treatise *On Not-Being* and his epideictical discourses (*Helena* and *Palamedes*). At first sight, given that Gorgias demonstrates in *On Not-Being* that communication is impossible, his claims hardly seem to leave any place for the power of rhetoric. Many critics, however, tried to escape the difficulty: some claim that it is the transmission of knowledge that is made impossible, allowing for the possibility of changing people’s opinion, while A. Mourelatos maintained that Gorgias rejects a representational conception of language but would defend a behaviorist one. Both solutions limit the scope of Gorgias’ arguments to make them compatible with his defense of rhetoric.
My aim in this presentation is to show that these solutions fail to make Gorgias’ theory coherent. A close examination of his arguments, both the “categorial” and the “interpersonal” ones, indicates that he makes it both impossible for language to transmit any representation at all and for the speaker to have any control on the mind of his interlocutor. This is due to the fundamentally polemical aim of the treatise *On Not-Being*: Gorgias does not really intend to establish the theses he supports, but only to show that it is possible to use philosophical arguments to demonstrate counterintuitive claims, thus undermining the pretension of philosophy to establish any kind of truth.
It is then in the methods rather than in the content of the demonstration that we may find Gorgias’ theory of language: discourse may have the power to change the opinions of the public, but since rational arguments can demonstrate one thing and its opposite, they cannot provide us with certain knowledge.
