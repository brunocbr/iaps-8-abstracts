The question of whether Parmenides' poem presents two or three ways of inquiry remains unsettled. While acceptance of Diels' conjecture in B6,2 (<*eirgô*>) would suggest support for three paths, my proposal firmly advocates for the dichotomous framework. I seek to elucidate the role of the Two Ways of Inquiry, but diverging from the commonly held interpretation that sees B2,5 as a mere statement of a false thesis. I aim to demonstrate how this path serves as an exposition of the ontological commitments of mortals. Contrary to the prevailing view, the Second Way is a crucial element in shaping a philosophically significant critical perspective on human experience.

To substantiate this interpretation, special attention will be given to the modal supplements of vv. 3 and 5 in fragment 2 (*ouk esti mê einai*, *kreôn esti mê einai*) through a predicative reading of the verb "to be." This analysis will highlight its correlation with the presence of Necessity in the transmitted text, particularly throughout the argument on being (B8,16; B8,30), and its potential identification with the cosmic divinity in fragment 12.[^2] It is the (real, cosmological) necessity of "non-being" that leads mortals to violate the principle of the identity of being and fall into self-contradiction when naming objects of opinion without knowledge of their true principles (B6,9; B8,53-59, cf. *dokounta*, B1,31-32; B9).

But how are we to fit cosmological thinking in the Parmenidean scheme? I propose that an attention to the distinction between categorematic and syncategorematic terms may throw light on this issue.

The methodology employed will not only involve the effort of a coherent reconstruction but also seek corroboration through an examination of the doxographical tradition that assigns a theory of opposing cosmological principles and make reference to a so-called section "Against Opinion" in the poem. This examination, as I will demonstrate, supports the proposed interpretation of the ways of inquiry in connection with both the criticism of mortal opinions and the cosmological theory, as they are attributed to Parmenides by various witnesses in the Aristotelian commentary and other doxographical traditions[^1].
