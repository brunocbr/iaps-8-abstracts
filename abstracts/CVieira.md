I will examine how Heraclitus’ human-scale items, such as rivers, barely-drinks, and bows remain in change. I use B84a ‘changing, it remains’ to map the possible relations between permanence and change. The participle can be read as:

- Concessive: despite changing, it remains
- Temporal: while it is changing, it remains, and
- Causal: Because it is changing, it remains.

The fragment is too laconic to provide an answer. So I go to the most accepted version of the river fragment, where the scholarly debate usually takes place. I divide the types of answers into two groups. The formalists offer higher-order aspects to ground the permanence of the river, e.g., the structure remains, but the water flows. Materialists prefer to ground persistence in physical aspects. e.g. The banks remain even though the waters change. I argue that all answers that ground persistence in a fixed element offer a concessive reading. It remains in spite of change. However, most interpreters agree that a causal reading is preferable. In search of a possible answer, I emphasize a usually neglected aspect. The people should enter the river. To understand this peculiar requirement, I go to B125, where one must stir the barley drink to understand the need of motion to constitute an integrated whole. I will suggest seeing the barely-drink as a manipulative, an object that works as a proof of concept, but only if one interacts with it. The necessity of interaction will shed some light on why people need to enter the river to grasp its persistence. Those who enter the river experience something that a mere observer misses, the power of the current. I will suggest that this underlying causal process may ground the river's persistence. To test the hypothesis, I apply it to the bow and lyre in B51.
