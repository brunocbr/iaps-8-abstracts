This paper proceeds from four insights into the nature of *aêr* in Homer and Hesiod: 
a) *aêr* is both darkness visible (as Kirk puts it) and the “very stuff of invisibility” (as West has it), and is thus in some sense radically underdetermined as a stuff; b) although *aêr* does not take a consistent form at the physical level, what it does do in each of its appearances is disrupt or interfere with perception or recognition, suggesting that *aêr*is better understood in terms of what it does rather 
than what it is; c) *aêr* plays a special role in helping the epic poet navigate narrative complexity; d) *aêr* is closely linked with the divine.

The paper’s central concern is to explore the consequences of these points for our understanding of Anaximenes, who makes *aêr* central to his physical theories. Is *aêr* exceptional in having the above qualities, and thus unusually appealing to a material monist or a generating substance theorist? Or is *aêr* exemplary in having these qualities, in which case fundamental aspects of our understanding of early Greek thought – including its relationship to what we call matter, as well as the aims and objective of early Presocratic thinkers – might need to be re-evaluated?

Because our view of the Presocratics is particularly shaped by the way we conceptualize the relationship between different Presocratic thinkers, how we understand the role of *aêr* in Anaximenes has important implications for how we understand the trajectory of Presocratic thought more generally; the paper therefore concludes by exploring possible implications for our understanding of subsequent Presocratic thinkers, especially Diogenes of Apollonia.
