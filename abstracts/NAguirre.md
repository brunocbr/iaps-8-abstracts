The present paper takes as its starting point the long passage of Theophrastus’ *De Sensibus* (§§ 7-24) devoted to discussing Empedocles’ theory of sense perception. As is widely known, this is the only place where a comprehensive and detailed exposition of the mechanisms involved in sense perception and cognition according to Empedocles’ theory can be found; in order to explain the workings of the organs of sense perception and the way in which men gain knowledge, a set of mechanisms is displayed in Theophrastus’ account of this thinker’s theory. Accordingly, the following processes can be specifically distinguished as relevant to the interaction among the ‘elements’ or with the medium: attraction by similarity (τὸ ὅμοιον), mixture (ἡ κρᾶσις), fitting into the pores (τὸ ἐναρμόττειν τοῖς πόροις), and effluence (ἡ ἀπορροή) which are viewed as fundamental operations or steps for the several functions of sense perception and cognition to take place. 
Among modern research devoted to this as yet not wholly clarified issue, the studies by Long (1966) and Curd (2016) about thinking and sense perception in Empedocles, as well as the paper by Sassi (2016), who set about to reconstruct a general theory of κρᾶσις in Parmenides and Empedocles, will be particularly considered for the purpose of this paper. In fact, despite the detail of Theophrastus’ account, scholars have often pointed out that there seems not to be a perfect match with extant fragments of Empedocles, probably because Theophrastus updated Empedocles’ language through Peripatetic terminology. Therefore, several possible connections between Theophrastus’ critical report and some extant fragments of Empedocles (Frr. 31B 3; 89, 90; 96; 98; 100; 106-109 DK) will be explored, so that, based on this comparative analysis, a new comprehensive attempt can be made here to outline Empedocles’ own presentation of the mechanisms of sense perception and thinking.
