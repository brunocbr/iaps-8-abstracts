I propose here to explore the philosophical point behind Gorgias’ *Defense of Palame\-des*, a speech in defense of a mythological character known for being unjustly killed. To do so, I identify parallels among the *Defense*, Parmenides’ Poem, and some fragments of Melissus regarding the reliability of logos for achieving knowledge about something.

Specifically, I consider how Parmenides’ goddess constructs \  a *pistos logos* through the presentation of an array of *sêmata* concerning *what exists* and her advice to the young man whom she addresses to use *logos* to realize a *krisis* between the two paths that she presents (B2).

Regarding Melissus, I analyze briefly the argumentative structure that he uses to establish one opposite over the other as a characteristic of what exists and then focus on his fragment 8, in which he presents his *megistos sêmeion* that *what exists* does so in the manner of what he calls *to hen*. I show that this argument concerns *logos*, for it traces back to the *semata* that Parmenides’ goddess uses to construct her *pistos logos*, and it concerns the manner in which people conceive *what exists* to be.

I then turn to Gorgias’ *Defense of Palamedes* and show that he gives to Palamedes’ argumentation a similar structure to Melissus’ argumentation in declaring that it is a *pistos logos*.

However, Gorgias and his audience are fully aware that Palamedes’ speech fails to lead the jury that hears his case to knowledge of the truth, namely, that he is innocent. In this sense, it is my contention that, based on the parallel that I propose here, Gorgias’ *Defense of Palamedes* can be also understood as a text that calls into question the reliability of *logos*, on which Parmenides’ and Melissus’ demonstrations rely.
