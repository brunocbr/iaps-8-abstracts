Several sources and ancient testimonia portray Protagoras as both the initiator of the
Sophistic movement and a thinker who engaged with two earlier pre-Socratic 
philosophers, namely, Heraclitus and Parmenides. More precisely, several witnesses 
assert that Protagoras both appropriated some contents of Heraclitus’ doctrine and 
rejected some of Parmenides’.
The following proposal aims to further inquire into this interweaving of doctrinal re-appropriations and rejections, as a more rigorous investigation can reveal how it is more complex than it may appear at a first glance. Protagoras’ re-appropriation of Heraclitus’ contents, in fact, does not mean that the Sophist merely repeated them without original re-elaborations of their theoretical structure. On the other hand, Protagoras’ rejection of Parmenides’ doctrine did not prevent several Parmenides’ theoretical assumptions from remarkably influencing certain aspects of Protagoras’ thought.
These seemingly paradoxical discontinuities within re-appropriation and 
continuities within rejection emerge quite clearly when focusing on a doctrine shared by both Protagoras’ and Heraclitus’ philosophy: the theory according to which reality has a contrasting physiognomy, being it composed of oppositions. Despite this commonality, Protagoras’ theory of reality as oppositional seems to be remarkably different from Heraclitus’ earlier one. More precisely, the theories of reality as intrinsically oppositional proposed by Heraclitus and Protagoras differ from each other in their conceptualization of these oppositions. One of the reasons of this difference, in turn, seems to be the contemporary influence of Parmenides’ theoretical assumptions on Protagoras’ thought. Thus, focusing on Protagoras’ re-appropriation of Heraclitean oppositions allows us to shed light on further evidence supporting the noticeable influence of Parmenides’ thought on subsequent thinkers, as it paradoxically seems to be positively influential even on philosophical systems that – just like Protagoras’ philosophy – are theoretically in disagreement with it.
