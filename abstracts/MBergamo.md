Among the Heraclitean sayings that have come down to us, fragment B62 DK is undoubtedly one of the most fascinating and elusive ones. If one were to give a tentative rendition of this short dictum, one could propose something along the following lines: 

> “Immortals mortals – mortals immortals: living the others’ death, dying the others’ life.”  
> ἀθάνατοι θνητοί, θνητοὶ ἀθάνατοι, ζῶντες τὸν ἐκείνων θάνατον, τὸν δὲ ἐκείνων βίον τεθνεῶτες.

Many interpretations have, as one would expect, been put forward in the attempt to shed light on this puzzling fragment, whose difficulty consists not only in the correspondence between mortals and immortals declared in its former half but also in the (intentional?) ambiguity of the cross-references (ἐκείνων… ἐκείνων) contained in its latter half, which in addition also turns on a semantically highly innovative and striking use of the expressions “to live one’s death” and “to die one’s life”.
In this paper, my aim will be that of providing a short history or reconstruction of the interpretation(s) of B62 developed in Antiquity, also on the basis of some new testimonies that I shall present in detail. Remarkable readings of the fragments have, indeed, been developed not only in the work in which the saying is quoted in the most faithful way, i.e. the *Refutatio* traditionally attributed to the Christian apologist Hippolytus of Rome, but also in the writings of a whole series of other authors. Broadly speaking, we can mainly distinguish sources harking back to a Stoic interpretation and testimonies pertaining to the Middle and Neoplatonic tradition.
By focussing in more detail on the latter set of texts, I shall set out the way in which fragment B62 was used for the purpose of stressing the double nature of the human soul and thus the possibility, for men, to free themselves of the limitations of the sensible realm in order to raise to the higher sphere of Intellectual life.
