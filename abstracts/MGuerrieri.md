The current arrangement of Parmenides’ extant fragments has been established in the fifth edition of *Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker*, the first to be curated by Walther Kranz (1934). This order considerably differs from the one that previous editors used, from Brandis (1813) to Diels. Nevertheless, to the present day, Kranz’s text has (almost) never been questioned. In this paper, I explore the main differences in the text before and after Kranz, specifically concerning the composition of pivotal fragments 28 B 1 and 7/8 DK. Indeed, Kranz implemented the following interventions: 1. Dividing the proem, testified by Sextus Empiricus, into two parts; 2. Enumerating the second part, i.e. its last six verses, as fr. 7; 3. Attaching these last verses to fr. 8 to create only one fr. 7/8 DK. Therefore, this paper addresses three main tasks: 1. Explaining the justification behind Kranz’s editorial changes to the text; 2. Demonstrating both the philosophical and philological reasons in favor of a return to the text of the proem quoted by Sextus Empiricus; 3. Arguing for a new philological intervention in the restored Greek text of the proem, by suggesting that a very simple *saut du même à même* could be the reason why the proem, as quoted by Sextus, lacks an important verse that is testified by Plato. In this last point, I also advocate for an interpretation of the poem’s division in two parts, starting from the new (or old) Greek text and examining the meaning of the much-debated adverb δοκίμως (28 B 1, 32) within it.
