The discussion concerning the attribution of authorship of the *De arte* mostly follows three paths: scholars sometimes claim that it is a text by a physician, sometimes by a sophist, or even by someone who is not only a physician, but also a sophist. In this paper, we will highlight the elements that would support the identification of this text as the work of a physician. To argue that, we first address some characteristics of medical practice that would require the ability to compose public speeches such as the *De arte*, and that, because of this requirement, the teaching and development of the art of speechwriting would also be present in medical schools. Moreover, we examine two passages of the text (III.1, 9-11; IX.1, 10-11) commonly used to attribute the authorship to a sophist. Our aim is to show that the first passage (III.1, 9-11) recommends the listeners to look for other discourses that teach more clearly over the nature of names (II.3, 4-8) and that the second passage (IX.1, 10-11) refers to the specificity related to each art, thus not implying that the author of the *De arte* composed other discourses that would defend the other arts. Furthermore, we analyze the use of the term μῦς (X.3, 15-1) in the medical context, comparing this passage with others within the Corpus Hippocraticum in which it appears with a similar meaning. Finally, we analyze whether the two prescriptions presented in the first chapter (I.2, 4-6; 8-10) derive from medical practice, more precisely from the struggle against visible and invisible diseases. Thus, we will intend to show that, in all probability, the author of the *De arte* is a physician, and this not only from a historical approach but also from an analytical and philological approach.
