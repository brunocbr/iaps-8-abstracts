It is well known that Heraclitus laid down his wisdom in a written book, which he deposited in the temple of Artemis. Choosing the medium of a written prose book, however, had important implications on the communication level: First, as a written book Heraclitus’s *logos* would only be accessible to a small educated elite capable of reading. Moreover, whereas in an orally recited poem such as Parmenides’ a strict one-dimensional line of argument is predetermined, in a written book the reader can browse freely forth and back to discover ever new correlations within a pluridimensional network of resonant and mutually illustrative semantic units (eyes are more accurate witnesses than ears, B 101a). Some of Heraclitus’s paradox ambiguities even essentially draw on the medium of writing, as is best exemplified by the bow fragment (B 48): The play with the prosodic ambiguity of the word ΒΙΟΣ (‘bow’ or ‘life’?) only works in written form, in archaic unaccented capitals. Words visually identical in writing become different when read and pronounced. For in those days, reading always meant reading aloud. Since Heraclitus insists that his *logos* should be *heard*, this may paradoxically be the very point of his recording his wisdom in writing: A book as an object remains silent and hides the contents of its *logos*. Yet as soon as someone opens it and starts reading, this person brings the *logos* to life and makes it ring out for others to hear. Every single reader thus becomes a new medium of Heraclitus’s words; and every reader of B 48 must needs think about how to read and understand it. And that may be exactly what Heraclitus wished his readers to do.
